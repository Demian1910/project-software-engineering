## Project Description
Write a short project description. This should clarify the following points:

- What are the goals of the extension?
- How does it integrate into the existing project and what functionality does it build upon?
- What are the main components of the extension? (Graphical User Interface, IO, Backend, External Modules, â€¦)
- What major challenges do you expect during implementation?

#### Papers analytics
The extension should be able to display with a chart analytics regarding the files characteristics in the repository,
such as the entry type and the field of the paper.
Currently, JabRef does not provide an overview of the characteristics of the files contained in the repository

We will be using the data
stored in the bib file, elaborate it and display the most significant information. 

We need: a data extraction modul to read and process the information in the bib file, 
an analytics engine to aggregate and analyse the data and a visualization component 
to display properly the results.



## Project Organization
- What is a possible division of tasks among the group members?
- How large do you estimate the overall project workload to be?  

There can be one person working on the extraction phase, two people working 
on the analysis of the date and two other people working on the UI via graph.
